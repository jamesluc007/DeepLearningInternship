# DeepLearningInternship
Este repositorio es creado con el fin de alojar proyectos de deep learning relacionados a la predicción de rendimiento de cultivo en Argentina a partir de imágenes satelitales. También se incluyen diversas arquitecturas de redes neuronales como práctica a fin.

This repository was created to save classifying and regression models which aim to predict crop yield in Argentina using Deep Learning on Satellite Images. Every file has been created and coded using Jupyter Notebook, but they should work using the Google Collaboratory platform as well.

Inside the folder IA, there are models programmed both using Keras and TensorFlow that work as a base (as a practice) to develop the final models to crop yield prediction. Each subfolder has (and MUST HAVE) a readme file. Some of them are in English, some in Spanish. 

With respect to the comments: Every file must be commented so every colleague can understand how the code works and what each line does.

Inside the folder Crop Yield Prediction, there must be the dataset used to train the crop yield prediction models as well as the models themselves.
