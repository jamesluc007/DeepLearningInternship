# DeepLearningInternship
This repository was created to save classifying and regression models which aim to predict crop yield in Argentina using Deep Learning on Satellite Images. Every file has been created and coded using Jupyter Notebook, but they should work using the Google Collaboratory platform as well.

This is just a part of a project that has two main actors: 

1. Universidad Nacional del Sur
2. "Bolsa de Cereales y Productos de Bahia Blanca"

And it's being developed by many colleages. This particular repository was coded by Luciano Bruna (jamesluc007, https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucianobruna/)

Inside the folder IA, there are models programmed both using Keras and TensorFlow that work as a base (as a practice) to develop the final models for crop yield prediction. Each subfolder has (and MUST HAVE) a readme file. Some of them are in English, some in Spanish.
